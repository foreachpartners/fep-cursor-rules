# Cursor Rules Development Workflow

## 1. Primary File Creation (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Create the Primary rule file following format `1-[techstack]-rules-guide.mdc`
2. MUST include all required sections as specified in @3-cursor-rules-structure.mdc section 3
3. REQUIRED to establish core principles specifically relevant to the technology stack
4. ESSENTIAL to define priority levels aligned with @1-cursor-rules-guide.mdc
5. REQUIRED to validate Primary file compliance with @4-cursor-rules-format.mdc

## 2. Secondary Files Planning (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Review @2-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc to identify all technical aspects requiring coverage
2. REQUIRED to collaborate with user on a comprehensive set of Secondary rule files ensuring:
   - Complete coverage of all relevant aspects from @2-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc
   - Logical grouping of related aspects in individual files
   - Clear file naming following the pattern `N-[techstack]-area-rule.mdc`
3. ESSENTIAL to discuss with user which aspects have highest priority
4. MUST document the agreed file structure before implementation

## 3. Secondary Rules Approval (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Present the complete proposed Secondary rules set to user
2. REQUIRED to explain coverage of all technical aspects from @2-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc
3. ESSENTIAL to clarify relationships between files and cross-references
4. MUST obtain explicit user approval of the complete Secondary rules structure
5. REQUIRED to document final approved structure before proceeding

## 4. Secondary File Development (P0)

1. CRITICAL: For each Secondary file, follow process in @6-cursor-secondary-rule-development.mdc
2. REQUIRED to develop Secondary files in approved order
3. ESSENTIAL to maintain consistent cross-references between all rule files
4. MUST obtain user approval after each Secondary file completion before proceeding to next

## 5. Coverage Verification (P0)

1. CRITICAL: After all Secondary files are complete, verify full coverage of aspects from @2-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc
2. REQUIRED to create a coverage matrix mapping each aspect to specific rule files and sections
3. ESSENTIAL to identify and address any coverage gaps with user input
4. MUST update rule files as needed to ensure complete aspect coverage
5. REQUIRED to get user confirmation that all necessary aspects are adequately covered
6. CRITICAL: Update Primary file with a complete rule navigation section referencing all created Secondary files

## 6. Rules Consistency Verification (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Verify internal consistency within each rule file
2. REQUIRED to ensure cross-file consistency across all rule files
3. ESSENTIAL to validate compliance with:
   - @1-cursor-rules-guide.mdc for foundational principles
   - @3-cursor-rules-structure.mdc for structural requirements
   - @4-cursor-rules-format.mdc for formatting standards
4. MUST verify all cross-references are accurate and functional
5. REQUIRED to resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies between rules

## 7. Completion Confirmation (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Present the complete rule set to user for final review
2. REQUIRED to summarize coverage and highlight key aspects addressed
3. ESSENTIAL to document any limitations or areas for future enhancement
4. MUST get explicit user approval of the complete rule set
5. REQUIRED to finalize all files and confirm successful completion of the development process
