# Cursor Rules Development Workflow

## 1. Development Process Overview (P0)

1. FIRST consult and strictly follow @1-cursor-rules-guide.mdc
2. ALWAYS follow the structured workflow described in this document
3. MUST apply formatting standards from @3-cursor-rules-format.mdc
4. REQUIRED to organize according to @4-cursor-rules-structure.mdc
5. STRICTLY implement test methods from @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc
6. MUST ensure complete coverage by referring to @6-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc

## 2. Development Workflow (P1)

1. Assess user preferences and priorities
2. Collect input on all technical aspects
3. Prioritize based on project needs
4. Implement in priority order
5. Validate with LLM testing

## 3. Planning Phase (P1)

1. Identify the problem or need the rule addresses
2. Research existing best practices in the domain
3. Define the scope and boundaries of the rule
4. Set measurable success criteria
5. Create a development timeline

## 4. Implementation Phase (P0)

1. Draft initial rule document
2. Review against formatting standards
3. CRITICAL: Check for duplicate content across rule files
4. REQUIRED: Verify consistency with existing rules
5. Gather feedback from team members
6. Refine and clarify based on feedback
7. Test with sample code or documents

## 5. Testing Phase (P1)

1. Apply rule to real-world examples
2. Verify rule clarity and usefulness
3. Test with different LLMs and contexts
4. Document edge cases and limitations
5. Make final adjustments based on testing

## 6. Deployment Phase (P2)

1. Add rule to appropriate directory
2. Update any related rule references
3. Document in central index or guide
4. Announce to team members
5. Collect initial usage feedback

## 7. Maintenance Phase (P2)

1. Schedule regular reviews
2. Track application metrics
3. Gather ongoing user feedback
4. Update for new technologies or practices
5. Archive or replace outdated rules

## 8. Self-Verification (P1)

When developing rules, ask:
1. Does the workflow process match the project needs?
2. Have all stakeholders been consulted?
3. Is the priority order correct?
4. Are tests sufficient to validate the rule?
5. Is there a clear path for updates and maintenance?
