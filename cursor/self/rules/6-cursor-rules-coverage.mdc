## 6. Usage Guidelines (P0)

1. When creating new rule sets:
   - Start with P0 aspects
   - MUST cover all required technical aspects
   - Progressively add P1-P3 aspects as needed
   - Verify all critical areas are addressed

2. When evaluating existing rule sets:
   - Check coverage against all required aspects
   - Identify and prioritize gaps
   - Create plan to address missing areas
   - REQUIRED to document coverage analysis results

3. When performing gap analysis:
   - Compare existing rules against this checklist
   - Score coverage of each aspect (none/partial/complete)
   - Create prioritized list of missing areas
   - MUST create plan to address critical gaps

## 7. Self-Verification (P1)

Ask these questions to verify correct usage of this document:
1. Have ALL required technical aspects (P0) been addressed?
2. Are coverage rules specific enough for practical application?
3. Do rules specify both WHAT and HOW for each technical aspect?
4. Has coverage been validated with stakeholders?
5. Is there a plan for addressing lower priority aspects?
