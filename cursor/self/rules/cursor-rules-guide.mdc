# Cursor Rules Development Guide

## 1. Priority Levels

- **P0** - Must implement (critical)
- **P1** - Should implement (high importance)
- **P2** - Recommended (medium importance)
- **P3** - Consider when possible (lower importance)

## 2. Core Principles (P0)

- Write rules as direct instructions, not suggestions
- Place the most important and frequently used rules first
- Include examples for all critical instructions
- Optimize for use within limited context windows
- Ensure rules occupy â‰¤20% of total context window
- Use self-verification mechanisms (see Testing document)

## 3. Development Workflow (P1)

1. Assess user preferences and priorities
2. Collect input on all technical aspects
3. Prioritize based on project needs
4. Implement in priority order
5. Validate with LLM testing

## 4. Required Aspects (P0)

1. **Code Structure**: directories, files, imports, naming
2. **Architectural Decisions**: design principles, patterns
3. **Type System**: interfaces, types, validation, generics
4. **Error Handling**: exception hierarchy, recovery
5. **Testing**: approaches, mocks, organization
6. **Dependency Management**: package managers, versioning
7. **Code Style**: formatting, naming conventions
8. **Documentation**: comments, API docs, README
9. **String Literals**: text constants, internationalization
10. **Constants**: types, placement, naming
11. **Configuration**: environment variables, config files
12. **Logging**: log levels, formatting, context

## 5. Additional Aspects (P1)

- **Framework Patterns**: framework-specific recommendations
- **Integration Points**: APIs, external services, databases
- **Developer Experience**: IDE, linting, workflow

## 6. Low-Priority Areas (P2)

- DevOps/CI/CD
- Advanced performance optimization
- Enterprise security
- Monitoring
- Future-proofing design

## 7. Rule Formatting (P0)

- Use valid Markdown checked with markdownlint
- Include YAML frontmatter (description, globs, related files)
- Apply hierarchical heading structure
- Prefer lists over long paragraphs
- Write all rules in English only

## 8. Success Criteria and Metrics (P2)

- **Clarity**: Rules are unambiguous and easy to understand
- **Adoption**: Rules are consistently followed in the codebase
- **Effectiveness**: Rules lead to measurable improvements in code quality
- **Feedback**: Positive user responses on rule usefulness
- **Maintenance**: Minimal effort required to keep rules updated

## 9. Self-Verification (P1)

Each rule should include verification questions:
- Does this rule apply to the current file?
- Is the rule being followed correctly?
- What specific aspects need improvement?
