# Cursor Rules Testing and Debugging Framework

## 1. Purpose (P0)

1. This document defines the testing and debugging approach for Cursor rules
2. When applying rules, the agent MUST report this by wrapping messages with debug markers
3. Debugging can be enabled by adding debug instructions to rule files
4. Debugging can be disabled by removing debug instructions from rule files
5. CRITICAL: Debug mode is intended for development use only

## 2. Debug Mode Configuration (P0)

1. Debug mode MUST only be enabled by explicit user request
2. Two operational modes MUST be supported:
   - Regular mode: No debugging information displayed to user
   - Debug mode: Detailed rule application information displayed to user
3. Debug mode MUST NOT affect rule functionality, only add informational output
4. CRITICAL: Debug mode MUST be disabled by default for production use

## 3. Debug Markers and Information Format (P0)

1. All debug mode output MUST be wrapped in designated markers using one-line format:
   ```
   [dbg]Debug information content goes here[/dbg]
   ```

2. At the beginning of each high-priority rule file, MUST add an instruction to output the file name:
   ```
   [dbg]Applied Rule File: [filename.mdc][/dbg]
   ```

3. When applying any rule, MUST output the rule identifier in the following format:
   ```
   [dbg]Rule [Section.Number]: [Short rule description][/dbg]
   ```

4. Examples of rule identification:
   ```
   [dbg]Rule 2.1: Code indentation[/dbg]
   [dbg]Rule 3.4: Error handling[/dbg]
   ```

5. Identifiers MUST be attached to each rule when applying instructions from @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc using the [dbg] tag

6. Example of required instructions to include in rule files for debugging:
   ```markdown
   # Instructions for outputting debug information
   
   1. When applying any rule from this file, MUST output debug information in this format:
      [dbg]Applied Rule File: [current-filename.mdc][/dbg]
   
   2. Before applying each specific rule, MUST output:
      [dbg]Rule [Section.Number]: [Rule title][/dbg]
   
   3. CRITICAL: All debug outputs MUST be wrapped in [dbg][/dbg] tags
   
   4. REQUIRED: Debug output MUST be added before each rule application
   ```

## 4. Debug Mode Activation (P0)

1. Debug mode MUST be activated by including this exact instruction in user query:
   ```
   Add debug information to cursor rules files
   ```

2. Debug mode MUST be deactivated by including this exact instruction in user query:
   ```
   Remove debug information from cursor rules files
   ```

3. Debug mode status MUST persist across conversation unless explicitly changed
4. CRITICAL: Status changes MUST be acknowledged with clear confirmation messages

## 5. Debug Mode Removal Tool (P0)

1. The following one-line `sed` command MUST be used to remove all debug markers from all files in a directory:
   ```bash
   find /path/to/rules/directory -type f -exec sed -i '/\[dbg\]/,/\[\/dbg\]/d' {} \;
   ```

## 6. Debug Mode Implementation (P1)

1. Each rule file MUST check for debug mode status before processing rules
2. When debug mode is active, rule files MUST wrap all rule applications in debug markers
3. Implementation MUST NOT affect rule functionality, only add informational output
4. CRITICAL: Debug code MUST NOT introduce behavior changes in rule application
