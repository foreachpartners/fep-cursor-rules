# Cursor Rules Development Guide

## 1. Priority Levels

1. **P0** - Must implement (critical)
2. **P1** - Should implement (high importance)
3. **P2** - Recommended (medium importance)
4. **P3** - Consider when possible (lower importance)

## 2. Core Principles (P0)

1. Write rules as direct instructions, not suggestions
2. Place the most important and frequently used rules first
3. Include examples for all critical instructions
4. Optimize for use within limited context windows
5. MUST implement self-verification mechanisms (strictly follow @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc)
6. MUST follow development workflow (strictly adhere to @2-cursor-rules-workflow.mdc)
7. ALWAYS consult this guide first before creating specific rules
8. REQUIRED to use coverage checklist (STRICTLY follow @6-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc)

## 3. Rule Formatting (P0)

1. Use valid Markdown checked with markdownlint
2. Include YAML frontmatter (description, globs, related files)
3. Apply hierarchical heading structure
4. Prefer lists over long paragraphs
5. Write all rules in English only
6. MUST follow formatting requirements (strictly implement @3-cursor-rules-format.mdc)

## 4. Success Criteria and Metrics (P2)

1. **Clarity**: Rules are unambiguous and easy to understand
2. **Adoption**: Rules are consistently followed in the codebase
3. **Effectiveness**: Rules lead to measurable improvements in code quality
4. **Feedback**: Positive user responses on rule usefulness
5. **Maintenance**: Minimal effort required to keep rules updated

## 5. Self-Verification (P1)

Each rule should include verification questions:
1. Does this rule apply to the current file?
2. Is the rule being followed correctly?
3. What specific aspects need improvement?
4. REQUIRED: Implement verification methods from @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc
