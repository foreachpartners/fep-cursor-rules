# Cursor Rules Development Guide

## 1. Priority Levels

1. **P0** - Must implement (critical)
2. **P1** - Should implement (high importance)
3. **P2** - Recommended (medium importance)
4. **P3** - Consider when possible (lower importance)

## 2. Core Principles (P0)

1. Write rules as direct instructions, not suggestions
2. Place the most important and frequently used rules first
3. Include examples for all critical instructions
4. Optimize for use within limited context windows
5. CRITICAL: Maintain strict consistency between all rules documents

## 3. Success Criteria and Metrics (P1)

1. **Consistency**: Rules are fully aligned and form a cohesive system without contradictions
2. **Context Efficiency**: Content is not duplicated between rules, maximizing available context
3. **Clarity**: Rules are unambiguous and easy to understand
4. **Adoption**: Rules are consistently followed in the codebase
5. **Effectiveness**: Rules lead to measurable improvements in code quality
6. **Feedback**: Positive user responses on rule usefulness
7. **Maintenance**: Minimal effort required to keep rules updated

## 4. Rule Navigation Guide (P0)

When you are addressing specific needs, MUST consult these rules:

### 4.1. Starting New Rule Development

1. ALWAYS begin with @1-cursor-rules-guide.mdc for foundational principles
2. MUST follow process in @2-cursor-rules-workflow.mdc to structure your work
3. REQUIRED to check @6-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc for technical aspects to address

### 4.2. Creating Rule Documents

1. MUST follow formatting standards in @3-cursor-rules-format.mdc
2. CRITICAL to structure documents according to @4-cursor-rules-structure.mdc
3. REQUIRED to include self-verification as specified in @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc section 7

### 4.3. Reviewing Existing Rules

1. MUST verify consistency using @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc section 15
2. REQUIRED to ensure complete coverage per @6-cursor-rules-coverage.mdc
3. CRITICAL to check for redundancy and duplication per @4-cursor-rules-structure.mdc section 10

### 4.4. Updating Rules

1. MUST follow @2-cursor-rules-workflow.mdc section 8 for maintenance
2. REQUIRED to confirm updated rules meet all testing criteria in @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc
3. CRITICAL to preserve internal and cross-rule consistency

### 4.5. Validating Rule Effectiveness

1. MUST implement metrics from @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc section 9
2. REQUIRED to compare against success criteria in section 3 of this document
3. CRITICAL to document validation results as specified in @5-cursor-rules-testing.mdc section 12
