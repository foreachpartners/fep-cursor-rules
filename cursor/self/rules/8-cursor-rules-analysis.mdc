# Cursor Rules Analysis Framework

## 1. Rules Analysis Process Overview (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Follow this structured process when analyzing rule files for a technology stack
2. REQUIRED to verify compliance with @1-cursor-rules-guide.mdc, @3-cursor-rules-structure.mdc, and @4-cursor-rules-format.mdc
3. MUST produce actionable findings and improvement plans
4. ESSENTIAL to maintain consistent standards across all rule files

## 2. Compliance Analysis (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Identify all rule files for the target technology stack in the specified directory
2. REQUIRED to check each file against these compliance criteria:
   - Foundational principles from @1-cursor-rules-guide.mdc
   - Structural requirements from @3-cursor-rules-structure.mdc
   - Formatting standards from @4-cursor-rules-format.mdc
3. MUST analyze each file individually and then evaluate cross-file consistency
4. ESSENTIAL to document all instances of non-compliance with specific references

## 3. Findings Documentation (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Group findings by severity using priority levels from @1-cursor-rules-guide.mdc:
   - P0 (Critical): Must address - affects ruleset usability
   - P1 (High): Should address - impacts clarity or effectiveness
   - P2 (Medium): Recommended improvements
   - P3 (Low): Minor enhancements
2. REQUIRED to provide specific references to relevant standards for each finding
3. MUST include clear explanations for why each item is non-compliant
4. ESSENTIAL to document cross-file consistency issues separately

## 4. Action Plan Development (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Create a prioritized plan to address all findings
2. REQUIRED to specify exact changes needed for each file
3. MUST estimate effort required for each correction
4. ESSENTIAL to propose a logical sequence for implementing changes

## 5. User Confirmation (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Present the complete findings and action plan to user
2. REQUIRED to explain the impact of each issue and proposed solution
3. MUST obtain explicit user approval before proceeding with changes
4. ESSENTIAL to clarify any questions and adjust the plan based on feedback

## 6. Plan Implementation (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Implement approved changes following the prioritized sequence
2. REQUIRED to address one file at a time, starting with the Primary rule file
3. MUST validate each change against original findings to ensure compliance
4. ESSENTIAL to maintain cross-file consistency throughout implementation
5. REQUIRED to document all changes made for future reference

## 7. Post-Implementation Analysis (P0)

1. CRITICAL: Verify that all identified issues have been properly addressed
2. REQUIRED to perform a complete reanalysis using criteria from section 2
3. MUST confirm that no new issues were introduced during implementation
4. ESSENTIAL to document the final state of compliance for all files
5. REQUIRED to report results to user for final approval
