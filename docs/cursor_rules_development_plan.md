# Cursor Rules Development Plan

## Overview

This project aims to develop a set of Cursor rules tailored for specific technology stacks such as Python/Django or TypeScript/Next.js. These rules will serve as guidelines and best practices for developers working with these specific technologies.

## Goals

1. Create comprehensive rule sets for various technology stacks
2. Enable users to easily implement high-quality development standards
3. Streamline the development process for specific technology combinations
4. Ensure consistency and best practices across projects using the same stack

## Implementation Strategy

1. Identify key technology stacks to support
2. Research best practices and common patterns for each stack
3. Develop rule sets that address:
   - Code style and formatting
   - Architecture patterns
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Performance optimization techniques
   - Testing methodologies
4. Create documentation for each rule set
5. Build a system for easy integration of rules into users' workflows

## Expected Outcome

Users will be able to install and apply these rules to quickly establish a robust development environment for their chosen technology stack. This will lead to higher code quality, better consistency, and improved development efficiency.

## Technology Stacks (Initial Focus)

- Python/Django
- TypeScript/Next.js
- JavaScript/React
- Ruby/Rails
- Go/Gin
- Java/Spring Boot

Additional technology stacks will be added based on user demand and community feedback.
